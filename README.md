# Machine Learning 
### Coursera - Stanford University taught by Andrew Ng

This course teaches machine learning techniques and includes a series of programming exercises to gain practices. It is required to write and run a computer program to solve machine learning problems. 

This is my solution to the series of challenges. I used MATLAB online and tried to vectorise my implementation avoiding a loop approach. The code runs faster and appears more like the mathematical expressions, making it easier to understand.  

Feel free to browse the code but i advise you to try to solve the challenges by yourself first. 

## Exercises
